# Gitpress

The idea behind gitpress is, that a static web is a fast web (if you do it right). And static websites can be veery beautifull and nice. For many things there is no need for constant php requests to a server. Gitpress shall be a extension or tool for jekyll, with wich you can have a simple WYSIWYG editor fully based on git. No cms, no php, all plain javascript html and css. for your static website needs.

This is a perfectionistic-tunnelvision project, and i dowupt that it ever will make it out of prototyping, but we will see. Current status is building a proof of concept prototype.
