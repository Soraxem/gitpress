**Strophe 1**  
Who am I that the highest King would welcome me?  
I was lost, but He brought me in  
Oh, His love for me  
Oh, His love for me  

**Refrain 1**  
Who the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  
I'm a child of God, yes I am  

**Strophe 2**  
Free at last, He has ransomed me  
His grace runs deep  
While I was a slave to sin, Jesus died for me  
Yes, He died for me  

**Refrain 2**  
Who the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  
I'm a child of God, yes I am  
In my Father's house  
There's a place for me  
I'm a child of God, yes I am  

**Bridge**  
I am chosen, not forsaken  
I am who You say I am  
You are for me, not against me  
I am who You say I am
