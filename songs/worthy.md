**Strophe 1**  
It was my cross you bore  
So I could live in the freedom you died for  
And now my life is yours  
And I will sing of your goodness forevermore  

**Refrain**  
Worthy is your name  
Jesus  
You deserve the praise  
Worthy is your name  

**Strophe 2**  
And now my shame is gone  
I stand amazed in your love undeniable  
Your grace goes on and on  
And I will sing of your goodness forevermore  

**Bridge**  
Be exalted now in the heavens  
As your glory fills this place  
You alone deserve our praise  
Youâ€™re the name above all names
