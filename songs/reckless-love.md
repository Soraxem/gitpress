**Strophe 1**  
Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me  
You have been so, so good to me  
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me  
You have been so so kind to me

**Refrain**  
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God  
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety - nine  
And I couldn't earn it I don't deserve it, still You give yourself away  
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

**Strophe 2**  
When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me  
You have been so, so good to me  
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me  
You have been so, so kind to me

**Refrain**  
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God  
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety - nine  
And I couldn't earn it I don't deserve it, still You give yourself away  
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

**Bridge**  
There's no shadow You won't light up  
Mountain You won't climb up coming after me  
There's no wall You won't kick down  
Lie You won't tear down coming after me

**Refrain**  
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God  
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety - nine  
And I couldn't earn it I don't deserve it, still You give yourself away  
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
