**Strophe 1**  
Blessed Be Your Name  
In the land that is plentiful  
Where Your streams of abundance flow  
Blessed be Your name  

**Strophe 2**  
Blessed Be Your name  
When I'm found in the desert place  
Though I walk through the wilderness  
Blessed Be Your name  

**Pre. Refrain**  
Every blessing You pour out, I'll  
Turn back to praise  
When the darkness closes in, Lord  
Still I will say  

**Refrain**  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your name  
Blessed be the name of the Lord  
Blessed be Your glorious name  

**Strophe 3**  
Blessed be Your name  
When the sun's shining down on me  
When the world's 'all as it should be'  
Blessed be Your name  

**Strophe 4**  
Blessed be Your name  
On the road marked with suffering  
Though there's pain in the offering  
Blessed be Your name  

**Bridge**  
You give and take away  
You give and take away  
My heart will choose to say  
Lord blessed be Your name
