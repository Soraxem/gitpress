**Strophe 1**  
I love you, Lord  
For your mercy never fails me  
All my days, I’ve been held in your hands  
From the moment that I wake up  
Until I lay my head  
I will sing of the goodness of God  

**Refrain**  
All my life you have been faithful  
All my life you have been so, so good  
With every breath that I am able  
I will sing of the goodness of God  

**Strophe 2**  
I love your voice  
You have led me through the fire  
In darkest night you are close like no other  
I’ve known you as a father  
I’ve known you as a friend  
I have lived in the goodness of God  

**Bridge**  
Your goodness is running after  
It’s running after me  
Your goodness is running after  
It’s running after me  
With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now  
I give you everything  
Your goodness is running after  
It’s running after me
