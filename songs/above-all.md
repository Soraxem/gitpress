**Strophe 1**  
Above all powers, above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  

**Strophe 2**  
Above all kingdoms, above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the Earth  
There's no way to measure what You're worth  

**Refrain**  
Crucified, laid behind a stone  
You lived to die, rejected and alone  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall and thought of me  
Above all

**Bridge**  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall and thought of me  
Above all
