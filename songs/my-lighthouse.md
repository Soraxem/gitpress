**Strophe 1**  
In my wrestling and in my doubts  
In my failures, You won't walk out  
Your great love will lead me through  
You are the peace in my troubled sea  
You are the peace in my troubled sea  

**Strophe 2**  
In the silence, You won't let go  
In the questions, Your truth will hold  
Your great love will lead me through  
You are the peace in my troubled sea  
You are the peace in my troubled sea  

**Refrain**  
My lighthouse, my lighthouse  
Shining in the darkness, I will follow You  
My lighthouse, my lighthouse  
I will trust the promise You will carry me  
Safe to shore safe to shore  
Safe to shore safe to shore  

**Strophe 3**  
I won't fear what tomorrow brings  
With each morning, I'll rise and sing  
My God's love will lead me through  
You are the peace in my troubled sea  
You are the peace in my troubled sea  

**Refrain**  
My lighthouse, my lighthouse  
Shining in the darkness, I will follow You  
My lighthouse, my lighthouse  
I will trust the promise You will carry me  
Safe to shore safe to shore  
Safe to shore safe to shore

**Bridge 4x**  
Fire before us, You're the brightest  
You will lead us through the storms  

**Refrain**  
My lighthouse, my lighthouse  
Shining in the darkness, I will follow You  
My lighthouse, my lighthouse  
I will trust the promise You will carry me  
Safe to shore safe to shore  
Safe to shore safe to shore
